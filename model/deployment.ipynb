    "- Save the classifier pipeline from basic solution to disk.\n",
    "- Load the classifier pipeline in an application.\n",
    "- Create an API which will take an audio wav file as input and extract features from it and get prediction from the loaded classifier.\n",
    "- Developing UI with a recorder where users can sing.\n",

    "- Accept WAV file as an input.\n",
    "- Extract features from WAV file.\n",
    "- Request model for prediction with the extracted features.\n",
    "- Check the model response and validate if the prediction probability is more than 75%. If prediction confidence is less than 75% return \"Uknown\" esle return the song name to the user."
